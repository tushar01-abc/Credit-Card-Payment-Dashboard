# Questions to be ask for this dashboard
1) Which city is the top performer by both transaction volume and total spending amount?
(Compares the "Count of Transaction_ID by City" with the "Sum of Amount by Card_Type and City")

2)Who is our single highest-value customer, and which card type do they use?
(Directly from the "Sum of Amount by Card_Type and Customer_ID" chart)

3)What is the most popular card type among our customers, based on total transaction value?
(Looks at the overall size of segments in the "Sum of Amount by Card_Type and City" chart)

4)Is there a city where the number of transactions is high, but the total revenue is disproportionately low?
(A cross-chart analysis to identify inefficiencies or different customer behaviors)

5)Which card type has the highest average spending per transaction?
(Requires combining total amount and transaction count data for each card type)

6)In the top revenue-generating city, which card type dominates the market?
(Drills down into the "Sum of Amount by Card_Type and City" chart for a specific location)

7)Are there any high-spending customers (e.g., in the top 5) who use less common card types like Discover or Annex?
(Analyzes the customer-card type chart to identify valuable niche segments)

8)Do we have customers who appear as top spenders across multiple card types?
(Seeks to identify loyal, high-value customers by scanning customer IDs across different card sections)

9)How does the customer base for Annex cards compare to Visa in terms of the number of high-value customers?
(Compares the number of bars and their values between two card types in the customer chart)

10)Based on this data, which city and card type combination represents the most promising target for a new marketing campaign?
